My portfolio showcases a website I have designed and developed for a furniture company. The website was created using HTML5 and coded on Adobe Dreamweaver.

The website consists of 5 pages, with a focus on showcasing the company's products and services. I incorporated the use of javascript and bootstrap to enhance the visual appeal of the website and make it more engaging for users. Additionally, the website is mobile responsive, ensuring that it is easily accessible and user-friendly on all devices.

One of the standout features of the website is the form page, where users can fill out their information and contact the company directly. This feature allows for easy communication between the company and potential customers, and it helps to improve the overall user experience.
